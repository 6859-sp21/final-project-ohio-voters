# Final Project: Ohio AAPI Voter Outreach Visualization Tool
### Darian Bhathena, Noah Faro, Rishi Shah


## Purpose & Project Overview
The purpose of our visualization tool was to provide civic engagement organizations greater visibility into AAPI voter data in the state of Ohio, as well as to allow grassroots organizations that do not have the resources to pay external organizations the ability to conducted targeted voter-level outreach. Overall, we felt that the process of creating this tool was an exercise not only in data visualization, but also included learning about the technicalities of such voter data sets and putting ourselves in the shoes of grassroots political organizers who would be the primary users of this visualization.

## Division of Work
The division of work was as follows: data preprocessing and documentation was primarily done by RS, while the scrolly telling was primarily done by NF and the map functionality was done by DB.
